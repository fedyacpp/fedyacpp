## What do I like?
- **Reverse Engineering**: Passionate about exploring and understanding the inner workings of software systems. Skilled in analyzing and reverse-engineering code. Developed APIs for accessing AI models by reverse-engineering websites.
- **Machine Learning**: Highly interested in machine learning projects, particularly those involving object recognition in images.
## Projects
### BlumClicker
An auto clicker for Blum's Drop Game, powered by a trained convolutional neural network (YOLOv5). The project aims to automate blum points farming. Currently, the project is considered complete.
### fnaf1bot
A work-in-progress project based on the same YOLOv5 network, which aims to automate the process of beating the game Five Nights at Freddy's (FNAF1). The project involves developing a bot capable of completing the game autonomously. Currently focusing on object recognition within the game images.
